# String_Compression

Huffman Coding: Optimizes string compression by assigning shorter binary codes to frequent characters and longer codes to rare ones.

Data Structures:

- HashMap: Stores character frequencies and Huffman codes.

- Tree: Custom tree structure for building the Huffman Tree.

- PriorityQueue: Min-heap to manage nodes with the lowest frequencies during tree construction.

Compression & Decompression: Compresses strings using Huffman codes and retrieves the original string from the compressed binary form.
